// ! Introduction to Problem solving

// ^ Objectives
// *  Define what an algorithm is
// * Devise a plan to solve algorithms
// * Compare and contrast problem solving patterns including frequency counters,two pointer problems and divide and conquer

// ^ What is an Algorithm ?
// *  Algorithm is a process or set of steps to accomplish a certain task

// ^  Why do i need to know this?
//*   Almost everything that you do in programming involves some kind of algorithm !
// *  It's the foundation for being a successful problem solving and developer


// ^  How to improve Problem solving skills ?
// * 1. Devise a plan for solving problems
// * 2. Master common problem solving patterns

// ^  Problem solving
// *  Understand the problem
// *  Explore concrete examples
// *  Break it down
// *  Solve/Simplify
// *  Look Back and refactor
