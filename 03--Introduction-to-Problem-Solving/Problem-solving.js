// ! Introduction to Problem solving

// ^ Objectives
// *  Define what an algorithm is
// * Devise a plan to solve algorithms
// * Compare and contrast problem solving patterns including frequency counters,two pointer problems and divide and conquer

// ^ What is an Algorithm ?
// *  Algorithm is a process or set of steps to accomplish a certain task

// ^  Why do i need to know this?
//*   Almost everything that you do in programming involves some kind of algorithm !
// *  It's the foundation for being a successful problem solving and developer

// ^  How to improve Problem solving skills ?
// * 1. Devise a plan for solving problems
// * 2. Master common problem solving patterns

// ^  Problem solving
// *  Understand the problem
// *  Explore concrete examples
// *  Break it down
// *  Solve/Simplify
// *  Look Back and refactor

// ^  Understand the problem
// * 1. Can i restate the problem in my own words?
// * 2. What are the inputs that go into the problem
// * 3. What are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem
// * 4. Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? In other words, do i have enough information to solve the problem?(you may not be able to answer this question until you set about solving the problem.That's okay;It's still worth considering the question at this early stage)
// * 5.How should i label the important pieces of data that are a part of the problem

// ^ Let's write a example and test what we wrote above
// ^ Write a function which takes two numbers and returns their sum

// % 1. Can i restate the problem in my own words?
// * Implement addition
// % 2. What are the inputs that go into the problem
// *  --Integers?
// *  --floats?
// *  --What about string for large numbers?
// % 3. What are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem
// *  --integers,float,string
// % 4. Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? In other words, do i have enough information to solve the problem?(you may not be able to answer this question until you set about solving the problem.That's okay;It's still worth considering the question at this early stage)
// % 5.How should i label the important pieces of data that are a part of the problem
